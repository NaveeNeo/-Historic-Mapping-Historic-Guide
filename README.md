#Historic-Mapping-Historic-Guide

An interactive user interface to select different cities India and to learn about their history and archaeological significance. Relation between all the cities in the past at one place. Technologies like HTML, JavaScript were used for the UI. Concepts from Data Structures and Graph Theory involved. 



PROJECT DESCRIPTION

India is a country with rich cultural heritage from ages.It has been ruled by many great Kingdoms, which has played an important role in History and Archaeology.
The project is all about showing relations between important cities .When clicked on a city, relevant information of the city is displayed. When clicked on two cities, the relation between those two cities which had an impact on the land, economy etc, is displayed.
For example when clicked on Madurai, historic information about the place is displayed but when clicked on Mysore and Madras,information about relation between the cities is shown.

Data Structures Used

Arrays : Used for storing the name of the cities and the information related to them
Graph Theory :
 Adjacency List- To define relations with two cities
 Adjacency Matrix - To check if relations exist between the two cities.


ALGORITHM:

Step 1: Start

Step 2:Input by the user in user interface

Step 3:Select the options.

Step 4: if (option is 1)
		Then 
   		    Step a: Get co-ordinates and get the city name.
  		
Step b: Use data Structure i.e Array and fetch the information 
about city and Display it
Step 5:if (option is 2)
		Then
Step a: Get co-ordinates and get the names of two cities     
by selecting both .
Step b:  Generate Adjacency Matrix Using  Adjacency 
List. Check whether relation exists 
between two cities and display it.
Step 6: Goto Step 3
Step 7:Stop

TOOLS USED

Browsers such as Mozilla Firefox to enable input and output functions and coding is done using JavaScript 
Concepts of Data Structures are used in the language JavaScript and Interfaced using a web browser.

CONCLUSIONS 
By means of this project,we were able to learn proper and efficient usage of Concepts of Data Structures and could analyze the places where it is being used.

We learnt how to use Data Structures in Javascript.
Data Structures concept can be used in any language and can be implemented with same logics.
